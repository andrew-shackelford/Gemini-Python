##### Because why build a "Sell All" button for your iOS app when you can make a script do it automatically for you instead!

This script uses the Gemini API to constantly track the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum, calculate how much of each I have, and sell all of it if/when the Bitcoin bubble inevitably bursts. Also I did this just because it was a fun side project. It's not like this is real money, right? Oh. It is. Well let's hope it works.

*To all the companies looking at this, don't worry - I'm not an idiot. I invested like $20, not something crazy.*
